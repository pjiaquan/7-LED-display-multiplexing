# 7-LED-display-multiplexing
4-Digit 7-segment LED Display

This is a project which took me 3 days to finish up.
What make me confusing is the NodeMCU light up the LED with the same number on the same time.
After searching online, I found that there are a technique call multiplexing which mean the current flow very quickly through the 4 segments but human eyes cannot determine.
